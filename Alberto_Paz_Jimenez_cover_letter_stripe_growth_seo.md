**Stripe Hiring Team**  
May 23, 2025

**Dear Stripe Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Full Stack Engineer, Growth & SEO** role on Stripe's Website, Product, and Platform (WPP) team. With 20+ years in full-stack engineering, I'm drawn to Stripe's unique position at the intersection of finance and technology, and the opportunity to contribute to a platform that empowers businesses worldwide.

Stripe.com represents the company's front door—the first impression for potential customers and a critical conversion point. What I find particularly compelling about this role is the chance to combine technical excellence with measurable business impact through a product-minded engineering approach.

At Flywire, I led several initiatives that directly contributed to growth and internationalization:

- **Multi-Market Deployment:** Implemented UI localization infrastructure that supported the launch of payment services in 7 new countries, directly contributing to a 25% increase in international adoption.
- **Internal Tooling:** Built a content management system that allowed our marketing team to update customer-facing content without engineering involvement, reducing update cycles from days to minutes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improved page load times by 40% through strategic caching and frontend optimizations, directly contributing to improved conversion rates.

While React is not explicitly mentioned in my CV, I've worked extensively with modern JavaScript frameworks including Angular, and the transition to React would be seamless. My experience with Ruby—combined with my front-end expertise—provides the full-stack foundation required for this role. Additionally, my work at ElevenPaths on multi-tenant platforms has given me valuable insights into building scalable, reliable systems.

## **Why Stripe's Growth & SEO Team?**  

- **Impact Opportunity:** I'm excited by the challenge of improving a platform that directly influences the company's growth trajectory and global presence.
- **Technical Excellence:** Stripe's commitment to building high-quality, high-performance web experiences aligns perfectly with my own engineering values.
- **Collaborative Environment:** I thrive in cross-functional environments and would welcome the opportunity to work closely with marketing, design, and other engineering teams.

While I am based in Madrid and would require a fully remote work arrangement, I am enthusiastic about making regular trips to Barcelona to meet with the team in person. I value face-to-face collaboration and believe it's crucial for effective teamwork, especially in cross-functional roles like this one. My experience with distributed teams has equipped me with the skills to collaborate effectively in a remote setting while maintaining strong team connections through periodic in-person meetings.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with full-stack development, internationalization, and performance optimization can contribute to Stripe's growth objectives.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
