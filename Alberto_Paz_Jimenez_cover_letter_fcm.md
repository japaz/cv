**FCM Digital**  
31 March 2025

**Dear FCM Digital Hiring Team,**  

I’m excited to apply for the **Senior Ruby on Rails Developer** role. With 20+ years in full-stack engineering—most recently building payment systems at Flywire and cloud-native platforms at ElevenPaths—I’m eager to contribute to FCM’s mission of reimagining corporate travel technology.  

At Flywire, I worked on **multiple critical projects**, including:  
- **Sandbox/Production Unification:** Redesigned Rails services to sync configurations/catalogs via messaging systems, cutting onboarding errors by 40%.  
- **Recurring Payments Solution:** Architected a scalable Rails API to automate subscription billing, reducing manual intervention for finance teams.  
- **Legacy Integration:** Working with SOAP-based APIs to ensure proper risk analysis.

FCM’s focus on building a **greenfield platform** (no legacy constraints) aligns perfectly with my experience. For example, at ElevenPaths, I designed a Kubernetes/AWS architecture for a security portal from scratch—scaling to support 500+ enterprise clients. I thrive in environments where clean code and smart architecture lay the foundation for future growth.  

### **Why FCM?**  
- **API-Driven Challenges:** I’ve integrated everything from Stripe to legacy banking systems (SOAP/SAML) and understand the grit required to connect disparate providers.  
- **Collaborative Agility:** My Scrum-driven work at VILT improved delivery predictability by 30%, and I’ve led teams across Spain and Portugal while colaborating with clients like Abu Dhabi Media Company.
- **Modern Stack:** Hands-on with **GitLab CI/CD** (and GitHub Actions), Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS.  

FCM’s mix of startup agility and global scale resonates with my career. I’d love to bring my passion for solving complex problems with Rails and APIs to your team.  

**Let’s chat—I’m ready to dive in!**  

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
