**Shypple Hiring Team**  
16 May 2025

**Dear Shypple Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Back-end Developer** position at Shypple. As a senior software engineer with over 20 years of experience in enterprise systems—specializing in Ruby on Rails and scalable platform development—I'm eager to contribute to Shypple's mission of simplifying the complex world of logistics through innovative technology.

My background aligns perfectly with your needs:

- **Ruby on Rails Development:** At Flywire, I developed and optimized payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS, focusing on scalability and performance—skills directly applicable to maintaining the high-performance, responsive platform Shypple requires.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Throughout my career at Flywire and ElevenPaths, I've worked with product managers, UX designers, and operations teams to deliver solutions that directly address business needs—mirroring your requirement for collaboration with cross-functional teams.
- **Problem-Solving Mindset:** At ElevenPaths, I built a Kubernetes/AWS architecture for a multi-tenant security portal from scratch, demonstrating the analytical problem-solving approach specified in your job description.

Shypple's commitment to transforming the logistics industry through technology innovation resonates strongly with my professional values. I'm particularly excited by your focus on:
- Creating intuitive, worldwide scalable products
- Building a future-proof platform with dedicated time for technical debt management
- Maintaining a collaborative team culture with a flat hierarchy

My experience leading distributed teams and implementing scalable systems positions me well to tackle the performance challenges inherent in a rapidly growing platform. While my core expertise is in Ruby on Rails, I'm eager to expand my skillset to include NodeJS and other frameworks as needed—I've consistently demonstrated the ability to learn new technologies throughout my career.

I'm confident that my technical expertise, collaborative approach, and passion for building scalable systems would make me a valuable addition to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with Shypple's needs and future goals.

**I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to Shypple's continued growth and innovation—let's connect to explore this opportunity further!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
