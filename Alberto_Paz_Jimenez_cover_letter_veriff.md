**Veriff Hiring Team**  
June 15, 2025

**Dear Veriff Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Senior Back-End Engineer** position with the Governmental Registries team. What draws me to Veriff is your ambitious mission to crack the online identity crisis at scale—a challenge that resonates deeply with my experience building secure systems at ElevenPaths and payment verification platforms at Flywire.

The opportunity to work on governmental registry integrations particularly excites me because it sits at the intersection of technical complexity and real-world impact. Your vision of making the internet safer while maintaining user convenience represents exactly the kind of meaningful engineering challenge I'm passionate about tackling.

During my time at **ElevenPaths (Telefonica Tech)**, I built the foundation for what would become a comprehensive Managed Security Services platform. The project involved creating secure, multi-tenant architectures that could handle sensitive data across different jurisdictions—experience that directly translates to the governmental registry integration challenges at Veriff.

One specific example that illustrates my approach: while developing our customer alert management system, we needed to integrate with multiple external security feeds while ensuring complete data isolation between tenants. I designed a processing architecture using Java and Apache Camel that could dynamically adapt to different data formats and security requirements. The system successfully handled thousands of security events daily while maintaining strict compliance standards—similar to the scale and security requirements I'd expect when integrating with governmental registries.

## **Why Veriff's Mission Resonates**  

- **Security-First Mindset:** My background building security platforms has given me deep appreciation for the delicate balance between user experience and robust verification
- **Scale and Complexity:** The technical challenge of integrating with diverse governmental systems across countries excites me as an engineer
- **Global Impact:** Enabling honest people to prove their identity safely online directly contributes to a more trustworthy digital world

While my recent experience has been primarily in Ruby on Rails and Java, I'm genuinely excited about working with Python and TypeScript. My diverse technical background—spanning C++, Java, Scala, and JavaScript—has taught me that strong engineering fundamentals transfer well between languages. At ElevenPaths, I successfully transitioned between Scala and Ruby projects, and I'm confident I can quickly become productive with Python while bringing fresh perspectives from other ecosystems.

The product-minded engineering approach mentioned in your job description particularly appeals to me. Throughout my career, I've found that the best technical solutions come from truly understanding the problem you're solving for users—not just implementing features in isolation.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my security systems experience and passion for building reliable, scalable backends can help Veriff continue making the internet a safer place for everyone.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
