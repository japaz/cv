**Akamai Enterprise Security Group (Guardicore) Hiring Team**  
16 May 2025

**Dear Akamai Hiring Team,**  

I am writing to express my interest in the **Senior Backend Developer** position with Akamai's Enterprise Security Group (formerly Guardicore). With over 20 years of experience as a full-stack engineer specializing in scalable enterprise systems, I'm excited about the opportunity to help build Akamai's world-class scalable backend platform for microsegmentation.

Throughout my career, I've demonstrated the versatility and problem-solving skills that align perfectly with Akamai's needs:

- **Scalable Backend Development:** At Flywire, I optimized backend performance for payment gateway integrations using Ruby on Rails and AWS, handling mission-critical financial transactions where reliability and security were paramount.
  
- **Distributed Systems Expertise:** At ElevenPaths, I designed and implemented a multi-tenant security platform using Scala (Play Framework) and AWS/Kubernetes architecture that scaled to support hundreds of enterprise clients.

- **Complex Problem Solving:** My background includes integrating diverse technologies and middleware solutions (Kafka, ActiveMQ, SNS) to solve intricate data flow and system communication challenges.

While my primary languages have been Ruby and Java, I've consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies. I'm confident I can rapidly become proficient in Python and Go based on my experience with multiple programming paradigms across object-oriented languages. My early career work with C/C++ provides a strong foundation for understanding systems programming that Go excels at.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to take ownership of the full feature lifecycle—from architecture and design through implementation and release—while collaborating across engineering, product, and operations teams. This end-to-end involvement matches my approach to engineering leadership.

I look forward to discussing how my background in scalable systems development, experience with distributed architectures, and passion for solving complex problems could benefit Akamai's Enterprise Security Group. I'm excited about the possibility of joining your team to build technology that makes a meaningful difference in how organizations protect their data centers and clouds.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to speak further about how I can contribute to Akamai's continued success.

Sincerely,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
