**Amenitiz Hiring Team**  
June 15, 2025

**Dear Amenitiz Hiring Team,**

I'm excited to apply for the **Senior Backend Engineer** position at Amenitiz. Your mission to simplify hospitality management across diverse markets—from Paris streets to Bolivia's Uyuni Salt Flats—really speaks to me. Having built scalable systems that serve enterprise clients worldwide, I understand how the right technology can transform entire industries, and hospitality is ripe for that kind of innovation.

What particularly draws me to Amenitiz is your focus on empowering over 14,000 hoteliers globally while maintaining that startup agility. As someone who has worked on payment systems processing millions in transactions at Flywire and multi-tenant platforms serving hundreds of enterprise clients at ElevenPaths, I know firsthand the technical challenges of building robust systems that scale across different markets and regulatory environments.

At Flywire, I faced a challenge that mirrors what Amenitiz likely encounters daily: building reliable systems that work across multiple countries with different requirements. Our payment processing platform needed to handle complex international transactions while maintaining the simplicity our customers expected. I worked on optimizing backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations and evolved our Apache Camel integration with customer engagement platforms—experience that directly applies to building the observable, well-documented software Amenitiz requires.

## **Why Amenitiz?**

Your commitment to **building from MVP to high-traffic systems** aligns perfectly with my career journey. At ElevenPaths, I helped design AWS/Kubernetes cloud architecture for a security portal that started small but eventually supported enterprise clients across multiple regions. I thrive in environments where you start with solid foundations and then scale intelligently.

The mention of **mentoring peers and influencing engineering standards** particularly excites me. During my time at VILT, I introduced Agile/Scrum methodologies to our development process and led teams building enterprise Java applications. I enjoy the collaborative aspect of senior engineering—not just writing code, but helping shape how the team approaches technical challenges.

Your tech stack of Ruby on Rails, AWS, and testing frameworks is exactly where I excel. My experience spans from building payment APIs to designing distributed systems, always with an eye toward maintainability and performance. Plus, having worked with both modern and legacy systems throughout my career, I understand the importance of writing code that future engineers (including yourself) will thank you for.

**I'd love to discuss how my experience building scalable, observable systems can help Amenitiz continue revolutionizing hospitality management across the globe!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
