## Opening (15-20 seconds)

Hi, I'm Alberto Paz Jiménez, and I'm excited to share why I want to join Tether as a Senior Node.js Engineer.

## Why Tether Excites Me (45-60 seconds)

What draws me to Tether isn't just the technology—it's the mission. You're building the infrastructure that powers global finance for hundreds of millions of people. USDT isn't just another cryptocurrency; it's become the foundation that enables instant, secure transactions worldwide.

I've spent over 20 years building systems that handle critical business processes, and I understand that when you're processing financial transactions at Tether's scale, every architectural decision matters. Every line of code impacts real people's ability to move money across borders, access financial services, and participate in the global economy.

What really resonates with me is Tether's commitment to transparency. In financial technology, trust isn't just important—it's everything. Your approach to building transparent, auditable systems aligns perfectly with how I think about engineering.

## My Relevant Experience (60-75 seconds)

At Flywire, I built payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS. I worked on optimizing backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations—the kind of work where reliability and security aren't optional. I also led the migration of our observability platform using OpenTelemetry, which gave me deep experience with distributed systems monitoring.

Before that, at ElevenPaths, I designed AWS and Kubernetes cloud architecture for a multi-tenant security platform. Working on security systems taught me to think about data protection and system integrity from the ground up—skills directly applicable to building financial infrastructure.

While my recent experience has been primarily with Ruby and Java, I've successfully transitioned between technologies throughout my career. I started with C++ building distributed systems, moved to Java for enterprise applications, then to Ruby and Scala. Node.js represents an exciting opportunity to apply my distributed systems expertise in JavaScript's ecosystem.

## What I Bring to Tether (30-40 seconds)

I bring experience with microservices architecture, both MySQL and MongoDB databases, and a security-first mindset. I understand the challenges of building systems that need to operate continuously across different time zones and handle the kind of scale that global financial infrastructure demands.

Your mention of peer-to-peer technologies particularly excites me. My research background at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid on distributed system scalability gives me appreciation for the coordination challenges in P2P networks.

## Closing (15-20 seconds)

I'm ready to contribute to Tether's mission of building financial infrastructure that increases global economic accessibility. I'd love to discuss how my experience with payment systems and passion for reliable, transparent technology can help advance Tether's platform.

Thank you for considering my application.
