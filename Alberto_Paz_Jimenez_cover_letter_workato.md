**Workato Hiring Team**  
8 May 2025

**Dear Workato Hiring Team,**  

I’m excited to apply for the **Senior Ruby on Rails Developer** role at Workato. With over 20 years of experience in full-stack engineering—most recently building scalable payment systems at Flywire and cloud-native platforms at ElevenPaths—I’m eager to contribute to Workato’s mission of transforming technology complexity into business opportunity.  

At Flywire, I led **key initiatives** such as:  
- **Recurring Payments Solution:** Architected a scalable Rails API to automate subscription billing, reducing manual intervention for finance teams.  
- **Sandbox/Production Unification:** Redesigned Rails services to sync configurations/catalogs via messaging systems, cutting onboarding errors by 40%.  
- **Legacy Integration:** Worked with SOAP-based APIs to ensure proper risk analysis.  

Workato’s focus on building **API interfaces and backend infrastructure** aligns perfectly with my expertise. For instance, at ElevenPaths, I designed a Kubernetes/AWS architecture for a security portal from scratch—scaling to support 500+ enterprise clients. I also have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, SQL databases, and modern caching mechanisms, ensuring efficient and reliable systems.  

### **Why Workato?**  
- **Innovative Enterprise Orchestration:** Workato’s mission to streamline operations resonates with my passion for creating impactful tools for businesses. I was particularly impressed by Workato’s recent recognition as a leader in enterprise automation by Gartner, which highlights the company’s commitment to innovation.  
- **Collaborative Team Culture:** I thrive in distributed teams, having led cross-functional groups across Spain and Portugal while collaborating with global clients.  
- **Technical Expertise:** My experience with Ruby on Rails, scalable architectures, and modern development practices ensures I can hit the ground running.  

Workato’s commitment to innovation and its recognition as a top company for remote workers make it an ideal place for me to contribute and grow. I’d love the opportunity to bring my skills in Rails development, architecture, and team collaboration to your team.  

**Let’s connect—I’m excited to discuss how I can help Workato achieve its goals!**  

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
