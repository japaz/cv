**Rewardful Hiring Team**  
8 May 2025

**Dear Rewardful Hiring Team,**  

I’m thrilled to apply for the **Senior Ruby on Rails Developer** role at Rewardful. With over 20 years of experience in full-stack engineering—most recently building scalable payment systems at Flywire and cloud-native platforms at ElevenPaths—I’m eager to contribute to Rewardful’s mission of empowering SaaS companies with seamless affiliate management solutions.  

At Flywire, I led **key initiatives** such as:  
- **Recurring Payments Solution:** Architected a scalable Rails API to automate subscription billing, reducing manual intervention for finance teams.  
- **Sandbox/Production Unification:** Redesigned Rails services to sync configurations/catalogs via messaging systems, cutting onboarding errors by 40%.  
- **Legacy Integration:** Worked with SOAP-based APIs to ensure proper risk analysis.  

Rewardful’s focus on building an **affiliate marketplace** and improving frontend architecture aligns perfectly with my expertise. For instance, at ElevenPaths, I designed a Kubernetes/AWS architecture for a security portal from scratch—scaling to support 500+ enterprise clients. I also have hands-on experience with modern frontend tools like React and Webpack, ensuring seamless user experiences.  

### **Why Rewardful?**  
- **Innovative SaaS Solutions:** Rewardful’s mission to simplify affiliate management resonates with my passion for creating impactful tools for businesses.  
- **Collaborative Team Culture:** I thrive in distributed teams, having led cross-functional groups across Spain and Portugal while collaborating with global clients.  
- **Modern Tech Stack:** My experience with Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL, and CI/CD pipelines ensures I can hit the ground running.  

Rewardful’s commitment to innovation and its entrepreneurial spirit make it an ideal place for me to contribute and grow. I’d love the opportunity to bring my skills in Rails development, architecture, and team collaboration to your team.  

**Let’s connect—I’m excited to discuss how I can help Rewardful achieve its goals!**  

Best regards,
