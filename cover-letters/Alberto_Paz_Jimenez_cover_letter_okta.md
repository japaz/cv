## Senior Software Engineer, Platform Infrastructure Application

Dear Okta Hiring Team,

What excites me most about Okta is your mission to make identity belong to everyone. Having spent over 20 years building enterprise systems that handle sensitive data and complex integrations, I understand how critical secure, reliable infrastructure is to enabling innovation. Your platform's role in securing 100 million daily logins while empowering development teams to move faster perfectly aligns with my passion for building foundational systems that scale.

My experience at Flywire directly parallels the challenges your Platform Infrastructure team faces. When we needed to modernize our observability platform, I led the migration from New Relic to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry across our Ruby on Rails payment processing system. This wasn't just a technical migration—it required coordinating with multiple engineering teams, ensuring zero downtime for payment flows, and creating documentation that enabled other teams to leverage the new insights effectively. The result was significantly improved application visibility and faster troubleshooting across our distributed AWS infrastructure.

Your focus on infrastructure-as-code and multi-cloud deployment resonates strongly with my background. At ElevenPaths, I architected AWS and Kubernetes solutions for our multi-tenant security platform, building systems that needed to scale across different customer environments while maintaining strict security requirements. My experience spans the full spectrum from legacy enterprise systems (working with Banco de España and La Caixa) to modern cloud-native architectures, giving me the perspective to build platforms that serve diverse engineering needs.

While my primary experience is in Ruby and Java rather than Golang, I've consistently demonstrated my ability to master new technologies quickly. When I transitioned from pure Java development to Ruby on Rails at ElevenPaths, I became productive within weeks and soon was optimizing integrations. My deep understanding of distributed systems fundamentals, combined with hands-on experience with Kafka, AWS, and containerization, positions me well to contribute immediately while ramping up on Go.

What particularly draws me to this role is the opportunity to work on cross-cutting concerns like service discovery and configuration at Auth0's scale. My experience evolving Apache Camel integrations and building Java multi-portal frameworks has taught me how to balance developer experience with operational robustness—exactly what's needed when building platform tools that other engineers depend on daily.

I'm excited about the possibility of bringing my infrastructure expertise and collaborative approach to help Auth0 scale for years to come. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building reliable, maintainable systems can contribute to your platform's continued growth.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
