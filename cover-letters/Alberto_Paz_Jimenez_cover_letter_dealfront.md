# Cover Letter - Dealfront Senior Ruby Backend Software Engineer

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Ruby Backend Software Engineer position at Dealfront. Your approach to building a sales intelligence platform through the Leadfeeder/Echobot merger caught my attention—creating something more powerful than the sum of its parts.

With 20+ years in software engineering and deep Ruby on Rails expertise, I bring exactly what you're looking for. At Flywire, I've built payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS, handling data-intensive applications where performance matters. I have hands-on experience with your tech stack: Ruby on Rails, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Elasticsearch, and Redis.

While I haven't worked with gRPC or Kinesis specifically, I've spent years integrating systems using Apache Camel, Kafka, and ActiveMQ. Learning new technologies has always been part of my journey—from C++ and DCOM to modern cloud platforms.

What excites me most is your emphasis on code quality and developer happiness. At ElevenPaths, I built multi-tenant security platforms where clean, maintainable code was essential. I've led technical debt reduction initiatives and know that investing in refactoring pays off in team productivity.

Your note about AI tools resonates with me. I've been experimenting with AI-powered development tools and see them as powerful allies. The fact that Dealfront provides access to leading AI coding assistants shows strategic thinking about developer productivity.

I'm based in Madrid, Spain, so the European requirement works perfectly. I'd love to discuss how my experience building scalable backend systems can contribute to Dealfront's mission.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
