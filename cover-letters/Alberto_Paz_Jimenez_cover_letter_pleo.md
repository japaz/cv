**Pleo**  
25 April 2025

**Dear Pleo Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Engineering Manager - Payments** role. With 20+ years in software engineering and leadership experience—most recently building payment systems at Flywire and cloud-native platforms at ElevenPaths—I'm eager to return to engineering management and contribute to Pleo's mission of revolutionizing business spending.

After a deliberate period as an Individual Contributor, I'm ready to leverage both my technical expertise and leadership capabilities to:

- **Build high-performing teams:** Create an environment of psychological safety while maintaining high standards and clear expectations
- **Bridge technical and business perspectives:** Align engineering efforts with product goals, optimizing for both customers and the company
- **Drive technical excellence:** Apply my deep technical knowledge to mentor engineers and guide architectural decisions in the payments domain

At Flywire, I worked on **multiple critical payment projects**, gaining valuable insights that align perfectly with Pleo's needs:

- **Payment Processing Solutions:** Architected scalable systems handling complex payment flows across multiple countries and currencies
- **Financial Systems Integration:** Worked with payment processing systems and implemented integration points between internal services to support financial operations
- **Team Collaboration:** While not in a formal management role, I mentored junior engineers and collaborated closely with product teams

What draws me to Pleo is your commitment to **authentic leadership and radical transparency**. I believe vulnerability and genuine care for individuals create the foundation for high-performing teams—perfectly aligned with your philosophy of leaders who stand "on the top of the mountain" with their teams.

My career journey has been purposeful—my time as an IC has deepened my technical knowledge while providing invaluable perspective on what truly enables engineers to thrive. This experience, combined with my previous management background, has shaped my leadership approach: building trust, providing clarity, and removing obstacles that stand in the way of delivery and growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique journey and leadership approach align with Pleo's vision for the Payments team.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
