# Alberto Paz Jiménez - Senior Software Engineer Application

## Dear Ceros Hiring Team

What immediately drew me to Ceros is your mission to transform the buying journey through interactive experiences. As someone who's spent two decades building platforms that solve real business problems, I'm excited about the opportunity to help brands create those half-billion annual views you mentioned. The fact that you're pushing web browsers to their limits while maintaining a no-code approach for users shows the kind of technical innovation I want to be part of.

Your search for a full-stack engineer who can handle whatever comes their way perfectly matches my background. Over 20+ years, I've built everything from payment processing systems at Flywire to multi-tenant security platforms at ElevenPaths, always adapting to whatever the product needed. At VILT, I led a team that built real-time dashboards using WebSockets—watching data flow live to users taught me how powerful immediate feedback can be, something that resonates with your real-time collaboration focus.

While I don't have direct Node.js experience, I've worked extensively with TypeScript for a year and JavaScript for many years across different frameworks. My Ruby on Rails and Java expertise has given me a strong foundation in backend architecture, and I've consistently picked up new technologies quickly throughout my career—from migrating Flywire's observability platform to Honeycomb with OpenTelemetry to building Scala applications at ElevenPaths. The architectural thinking remains the same whether it's Rails, Spring MVC, or Node.js.

What excites me most about this role is the greenfield refactoring project you described. At Flywire, I led technical debt reduction initiatives that improved maintainability across our payment platform. At VILT, I built a Java multi-portal framework that cut maintenance costs by 40% for major clients like Banco de España. I approach these modernization challenges incrementally—testing and learning rather than big-bang rewrites—which aligns perfectly with your described methodology.

Your emphasis on cross-functional collaboration appeals to me because I've always worked closely with diverse teams. At ElevenPaths, I coordinated between security analysts, front-end developers, and infrastructure teams to deliver our managed security platform. When you mentioned checking egos at the door and honest debate about ideas, that describes exactly the kind of environment where I do my best work.

Having worked primarily in smaller companies and startups, I understand the fast-moving environment where self-motivation drives progress. At VILT, I introduced Agile/Scrum methodologies that improved delivery predictability by 30%, and I've consistently taken ownership of complex projects from conception to production deployment.

I'm particularly drawn to your focus on exceptional user experience. Whether it was building customer-facing portals at ElevenPaths or optimizing payment flows at Flywire, I've always kept the end user in mind while writing maintainable, well-architected code.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my full-stack experience and passion for building scalable platforms can contribute to Ceros's mission. I'm ready to dive into TypeScript and Node.js while bringing my architectural expertise to help shape the future of your product.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
