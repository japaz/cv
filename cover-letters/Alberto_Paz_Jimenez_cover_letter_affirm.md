**Dear Affirm Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Staff Software Engineer, Backend (Search Platform)** role at Affirm. What draws me to this opportunity is building systems that help millions find the right financing options—combining the technical challenges I love with clear business impact.

With 20+ years designing and scaling backend systems, I bring deep experience with the technologies your team uses: Ruby on Rails, AWS, Kubernetes, and distributed systems architecture.

At Flywire, I developed payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS, optimizing backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations. At ElevenPaths, I built a multi-tenant security platform using Scala, Ruby on Rails, and AWS/Kubernetes cloud architecture—experience that directly transfers to building scalable search systems.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

- **Technical Leadership:** Led engineering teams at VILT and have experience setting technical strategy—aligning with the staff-level responsibilities
- **Search Experience:** I have experience with Elasticsearch (from which OpenSearch was forked), providing a solid foundation for the search technologies your team uses
- **Relevant Domain:** Payment systems experience at Flywire provides valuable context for financial platforms

**I'd love to discuss how my distributed systems expertise and technical leadership can contribute to Affirm's search platform.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
