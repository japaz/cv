**Cover Letter - Middle Team Lead Position**  
**Volkswagen Digital:Hub**

---

Dear Hiring Team,

What immediately caught my attention about Volkswagen Digital:Hub is the unique combination of startup agility backed by one of the world's most established automotive companies. Having spent my career building enterprise systems, the opportunity to apply that experience in the consumer goods market while helping shape the future of mobility is genuinely exciting.

With over 20 years in software development and nearly a decade of team leadership experience, I bring exactly what you're looking for in a Middle Team Lead. As Engineering Manager at VILT, I led teams of 6-8 developers building enterprise Java applications for major clients like Banco de España and La Caixa. More recently, at ElevenPaths, I took on team lead responsibilities while architecting cloud solutions using AWS and Kubernetes.

Your emphasis on being the "oil for the team" really resonates with my leadership philosophy. When I introduced Agile methodologies at VILT, I didn't just implement new processes—I spent time understanding each developer's working style and helped remove the friction points that were slowing them down. This approach improved our delivery predictability and, more importantly, created an environment where the team felt supported to do their best work.

My technical background aligns well with your requirements. I have extensive experience with Java and the Spring ecosystem, having built enterprise systems with Spring MVC and Hibernate throughout my career. While I've worked primarily with RSpec for testing in my Ruby projects, I'm confident in quickly adapting to Jest and Cypress—the principles of TDD that I've practiced for years translate across frameworks. My AWS experience includes Lambda and CloudWatch, and I'm eager to expand into the other services you mentioned like Glue and DynamoDB.

What excites me most is your culture of continuous learning and individual growth. Publishing IEEE research on J2EE scalability early in my career taught me that the best solutions come from teams that aren't afraid to explore new approaches. Your startup environment within Volkswagen's global network seems like the perfect place to combine that innovative mindset with the stability needed to build truly scalable products.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my leadership experience and technical background can contribute to your team's success. I'm available for a conversation at your convenience and am excited about the possibility of joining Volkswagen Digital:Hub.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
