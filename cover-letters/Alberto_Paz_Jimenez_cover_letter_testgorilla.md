**TestGorilla Hiring Team**  
June 24, 2025

**Dear Raùl and the TestGorilla Team,**

What immediately drew me to TestGorilla is your mission to create a world where everyone lands their dream job through skills-based hiring. Having spent over 20 years building systems that need to work reliably at scale, I deeply appreciate how the right technology can transform entire industries. TestGorilla's approach of replacing resume bias with actual skills assessment resonates with my belief that technical capability should speak louder than credentials.

Your Senior Software Engineer, AI/ML Platform role presents exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary challenge I thrive on—bridging software engineering, data engineering, and modern AI/ML development. With my background building scalable backend systems and integrating complex data pipelines, I'm excited to help TestGorilla scale its AI-powered hiring platform.

## **Technical Alignment**

My experience maps well to your core requirements:

**Data Pipeline & Integration Expertise**: At both ElevenPaths and Flywire, I worked extensively with **Apache Camel** to build robust data integration systems. At ElevenPaths, I developed Java/Apache Camel processors for real-time security event handling, while at Flywire I evolved Apache Camel integrations with customer engagement platforms. This experience with ETL/ELT patterns and messaging systems directly applies to building the data infrastructure your AI/ML platform requires.

**Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps**: I have hands-on **AWS experience** spanning multiple roles, including designing Kubernetes architectures at ElevenPaths and optimizing cloud infrastructure at Flywire. My work includes containerization, CI/CD pipeline implementation, and Infrastructure-as-Code practices—exactly what's needed for operationalizing AI/ML models.

**Backend Services & APIs**: With Ruby on Rails as my primary stack and experience across Java, Scala, and TypeScript, I bring strong skills in developing scalable backend services. My work has consistently focused on building reliable APIs that serve enterprise clients, which translates well to the AI/ML service APIs your platform requires.

## **Adapting to Your Tech Stack**

While I don't have professional Python experience, my background across multiple languages (Ruby, Java, Scala, C++, JavaScript) demonstrates strong adaptability. I'm confident in my ability to quickly become productive in Python given this foundation, especially considering the algorithmic and systems thinking skills transfer directly.

Regarding AI/ML, I'm actively exploring this space through personal projects with LLMs and studying prompt engineering techniques. While I haven't deployed production AI/ML models professionally, my experience integrating complex third-party APIs and building event-driven architectures provides a solid foundation for working with AI service APIs and understanding MLOps workflows.

## **Why This Excites Me**

TestGorilla's commitment to bias-free hiring through scientifically validated assessments aligns perfectly with my engineering philosophy—let the work speak for itself. Your global, remote-first culture and focus on continuous learning particularly appeal to me. Having worked with distributed teams across multiple time zones, I understand the collaboration and communication skills needed to succeed in this environment.

The opportunity to help build the infrastructure that powers fairer hiring decisions worldwide is genuinely motivating. Your platform doesn't just solve a technical problem—it helps create a more equitable job market where skills and potential matter more than background or presentation.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to take one of your assessments and discuss how my experience building reliable, scalable systems can help TestGorilla continue revolutionizing how companies hire. Let's explore how my technical background and passion for meaningful work can contribute to your mission.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
