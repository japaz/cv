## Rithum - Senior Software Engineer - Fullstack (TypeScript/Angular)

---

Dear Rithum Hiring Team,

What caught my attention about Rithum is the scale of impact—powering over $50 billion in annual GMV across 40,000+ companies. That's the kind of platform where technical decisions truly matter, and where my 20+ years of experience building scalable systems would make a real difference.

I have solid experience with both TypeScript and Angular from my work at ElevenPaths, where I built an Angular/TypeScript SPA for customer ticket and alert management that served enterprise security clients. While I wouldn't call myself an expert in these technologies yet, my background with JavaScript and modern frontend frameworks gives me a strong foundation to build upon. My experience leading development teams has taught me how crucial it is to write maintainable, well-structured code that other engineers can easily understand and extend.

While I don't have production Rust experience yet, my track record shows I pick up new languages quickly. I've successfully transitioned between Java, Scala, Ruby, and TypeScript throughout my career—each time becoming productive within weeks. My experience with systems programming in C++ gives me a solid foundation for understanding Rust's concepts, and I'm confident I can become effective with it quickly.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to work at the intersection of commerce and technology. My experience modernizing legacy systems while maintaining high availability—like migrating Banco de España's intranet architecture—has taught me how to balance innovation with reliability. This matches perfectly with Rithum's need to support thousands of companies while continuously evolving the platform.

Your emphasis on the "you build it, you run it" mentality resonates with my approach to software development. At Flywire, I took ownership of payment processing systems from development through production support, and I understand the importance of building with operational excellence in mind from day one.

I'm ready to contribute to Rithum's mission of creating seamless e-commerce experiences. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building scalable platforms and leading technical initiatives can help drive your engineering goals forward.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
