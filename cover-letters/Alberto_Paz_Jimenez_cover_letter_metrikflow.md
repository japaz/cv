**Metrikflow Hiring Team**  
June 16, 2025

**Dear Metrikflow Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Senior Software Engineer** position at Metrikflow. Your data-driven approach to solving complex environmental challenges resonates deeply with me—this is exactly the kind of meaningful work that makes a real difference.

With over 20 years of full-stack engineering experience, I bring the scalable application development skills you're seeking. While I don't have extensive Node.js experience, I have a solid JavaScript and TypeScript foundation from my Angular work at ElevenPaths, plus a proven track record of quickly mastering new stacks throughout my career (C++ → Java → Ruby).

At ElevenPaths, I built a multi-tenant security platform handling complex data flows for managed security services. This experience with Angular/TypeScript frontends and real-time data processing taught me the clean architecture patterns and performance optimization skills that translate directly to your Node.js environment.

My background covers your key requirements: 20+ years of full-stack development, SQL/NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB), modern architecture (AWS/Kubernetes), and RESTful API design.

What draws me to Metrikflow: contributing to sustainability solutions, tackling complex climate-tech challenges, and helping shape the future of environmental technology. Based in Madrid, I'm perfectly positioned for your European timezone and excited about quarterly team collaboration in Berlin.

I'm genuinely excited about diving into Node.js development—it's a natural progression from my current skillset, and I'm confident I can hit the ground running.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building scalable systems and passion for environmental impact can help Metrikflow become the leading ESG platform in Italy and beyond.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
