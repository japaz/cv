## Cover Letter - Staff Full-Stack Engineer (Backend-Focused)

Dear deskbird Hiring Team,

What excites me most about deskbird is how you're solving a problem I've lived firsthand. I've been working remotely since 2020 and in hybrid arrangements since 2012 – long before it became mainstream. Your mission to revolutionize hybrid work resonates deeply with my experience of watching teams struggle with coordination, office planning, and the balance between remote flexibility and in-person collaboration.

With over 20 years of full-stack engineering experience and a strong backend focus, I'm particularly drawn to your technical challenges around event-driven architecture and service decomposition. At Flywire, I worked extensively with event-driven communications between microservices, building robust integrations that handled real-time payment processing for thousands of users. When our team needed to optimize performance for third-party gateway integrations, I led the implementation of YJIT in our Rails stack, significantly improving throughput for our payment processing system. This kind of hands-on performance optimization work, combined with architectural thinking, is exactly what drives me.

Your emphasis on technical leadership aligns perfectly with my background. At VILT, I was promoted from Project Manager to Engineering Manager, leading teams of 6-8 developers while building enterprise Java systems for clients like Banco de España and La Caixa. I introduced Agile methodologies that improved delivery predictability, and built a multi-portal framework that cut maintenance costs dramatically. Similarly, at BearingPoint, I led Java teams developing financial platforms for Telefónica Móviles, always balancing hands-on coding with strategic technical decisions.

While my expertise centers on Ruby on Rails, Java, and AWS, I've worked across the full stack throughout my career. I've contributed to Angular and React codebases using TypeScript, and my experience with distributed systems, microservices, and API design translates directly to the Node.js and NestJS environment you're using. I'm confident in my ability to quickly adapt these skills to your tech stack while bringing fresh perspectives from other ecosystems.

What particularly appeals to me about this role is the opportunity to shape architecture for a platform that's genuinely improving how people work. Having experienced the challenges of hybrid coordination across multiple companies and teams, I understand the real-world problems deskbird solves. I'd love to discuss how my backend expertise, leadership experience, and personal understanding of hybrid work challenges can contribute to your continued growth.

I'm excited about the possibility of joining your mission and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can help drive deskbird's technical evolution.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
