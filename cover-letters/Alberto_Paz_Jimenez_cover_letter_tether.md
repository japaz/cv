**Tether Hiring Team**  
June 15, 2025

**Dear Tether Hiring Team,**

I'm excited to apply for the **Node.js Senior Software Engineer** position at Tether. What captivates me most about this opportunity is Tether's revolutionary impact on global finance—building infrastructure that powers hundreds of millions of transactions worldwide while maintaining the transparency that makes digital finance trustworthy. Your USDT stablecoin isn't just a product; it's the foundation that enables instant, secure global transactions at unprecedented scale.

Having spent years building payment processing systems at Flywire, I understand the critical balance between scalability, security, and reliability that defines successful financial platforms. When working on payment systems, every architectural decision impacts real people's financial lives—exactly the kind of meaningful responsibility that drives my best engineering work.

At Flywire, I optimized backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations. The challenge wasn't just building the APIs—it was creating robust systems that could handle payment processing while maintaining the security standards that financial institutions demand. This work involved designing event-driven architectures with Apache Camel, implementing real-time monitoring systems, and maintaining the reliability that critical financial operations require.

## Why Tether's Mission Resonates

Your commitment to **transparency and global accessibility** aligns perfectly with my engineering values. I've experienced firsthand how proper financial infrastructure can eliminate barriers through my work on payment systems at Flywire. Tether's mission to democratize financial access resonates deeply with that experience.

My background spans the key areas critical to Tether's backend development:

- **Microservices Architecture:** Built scalable systems using Ruby on Rails, Scala (Play Framework), and AWS/Kubernetes that handled enterprise-level loads
- **Database Expertise:** Extensive experience with both MySQL and MongoDB, including performance optimization
- **Security-First Development:** At ElevenPaths, I designed multi-tenant security platforms where data protection and system integrity were paramount
- **Distributed Systems:** Led migration of observability infrastructure using OpenTelemetry, managing complex distributed services across cloud environments

While my recent experience centers on Ruby and Java ecosystems, my technical foundation is built for adaptability. I've successfully transitioned between languages throughout my career—from C++ in early distributed systems work to modern cloud-native technologies. Node.js represents an exciting opportunity to apply my distributed systems expertise in JavaScript's ecosystem, and I'm genuinely enthusiastic about mastering this stack.

Your mention of **peer-to-peer technologies** particularly excites me. My early research work at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid on distributed system scalability gives me appreciation for the complex coordination challenges in P2P networks. The combination of blockchain integration, high-availability systems, and message queue architectures represents exactly the kind of technical challenge that energizes me.

The **remote-first global team** structure at Tether matches my working style perfectly. Having collaborated with distributed teams while supporting international clients, I understand how to maintain strong communication and deliver reliable results across time zones. My experience building systems that operate continuously aligns well with the 24/7 nature of global digital finance.

**I'm ready to contribute to Tether's mission of building the financial infrastructure that powers the digital economy. Let's discuss how my experience with scalable payment systems and passion for transparent, secure technology can help advance Tether's revolutionary platform!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
