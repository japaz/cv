**Dear Fever Engineering Team,**

I'm thrilled to apply for the **Senior Software Engineer** position at Fever. Your mission to democratize access to culture and entertainment resonates deeply with me—technology that brings joy and discovery to 300+ million people monthly is exactly the kind of meaningful impact I want to help create.

At Flywire, I developed payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS, focusing on optimizing backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations. While my professional experience centers on Ruby, Java, and Scala, I've used Python for personal data processing projects with local LLMs and am eager to apply it professionally—I'm a quick learner who adapts rapidly to new tech stacks.

What draws me to Fever is your focus on getting things done right, not just done. During my time at ElevenPaths, I worked closely with a tight-knit engineering team who valued code quality as much as delivery speed, building robust testing practices into our development process. I understand the balance between moving fast and building systems that can scale globally.

## Why Fever?

Your engineering culture speaks to me. I thrive in environments where CI/CD isn't just a buzzword but a foundation for confident deployments. My experience migrating systems to cloud architectures (AWS/Kubernetes) and working with event-driven systems would help as you continue scaling your platform.

I'm particularly excited about your hackdays and collaborative culture. Some of my best solutions have emerged from those spontaneous technical discussions where different perspectives help solve complex problems.

While I haven't worked with Django specifically, your stack's focus on PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ resonates with my distributed systems experience. I've built messaging architectures with similar technologies and understand the challenges of maintaining consistency across microservices at scale.

**I'd love to discuss how my passion for quality engineering can contribute to Fever's mission of transforming how people discover culture!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
