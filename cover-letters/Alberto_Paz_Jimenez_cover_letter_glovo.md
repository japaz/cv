What excites me most about Glovo is your mission to give everyone easy access to anything in their cities. Having spent over 20 years building the infrastructure that powers digital experiences, I understand how critical reliable platform engineering is to making that vision reality for millions of users across 23 countries.

My experience aligns strongly with what you're building. At Flywire, I've worked extensively with AWS cloud infrastructure, developing payment processing systems that handle high-volume, mission-critical transactions. I migrated our observability platform from New Relic to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry, which taught me how proper monitoring and observability are essential for distributed systems at scale. This experience directly applies to your needs for platform observability and reliability engineering.

While my hands-on Kubernetes experience comes from working with containerized applications rather than managing the orchestration platform itself, I've spent years building distributed systems and handling the operational challenges that come with them. At ElevenPaths, I architected AWS cloud solutions for multi-tenant security platforms, which required deep understanding of networking, security, and infrastructure as code principles.

Your emphasis on developer productivity resonates with my leadership experience. When I led engineering teams at VILT, I introduced Agile methodologies that improved delivery predictability. I've always believed that good infrastructure should be invisible to developers—letting them focus on building features rather than fighting the platform.

I'm particularly drawn to your GitOps approach with Argo CD and CI/CD best practices. Throughout my career, I've seen how proper automation and deployment practices can make or break a platform team's effectiveness. My background with Java enterprise systems and Ruby on Rails gives me a solid foundation for understanding the deployment and operational needs of different application stacks.

I should mention that I'm looking for a fully remote position with occasional travel to the office when needed for team collaboration or critical projects. I believe my 20+ years of experience working with distributed teams and my track record of delivering results remotely make this arrangement effective.

I'd love to discuss how my infrastructure experience and passion for building reliable, scalable systems can help Glovo continue revolutionizing how people connect with their everyday needs. Are you open to exploring a remote arrangement for this role?

Best regards,
