What draws me to AirDNA is your approach to transforming complex data into actionable insights for the short-term rental market. Having worked extensively with data-rich payment processing systems at Flywire, I understand the technical challenges of building reliable platforms that users depend on for critical financial decisions—much like how AirDNA's users rely on your data to make smart investment choices.

With over 20 years of full-stack development experience, I bring exactly the Ruby expertise you're seeking. While my recent work at Flywire focused on Ruby on Rails for payment gateway integrations and AWS-based systems, I've also worked with other Ruby frameworks like Sinatra and Sequel, giving me the adaptability to quickly master Hanami and rom-rb. My experience spans your entire tech stack: PostgreSQL for complex data queries, JavaScript frameworks (primarily Angular with some React experience), RESTful API design, and AWS cloud architecture. At ElevenPaths, I built multi-tenant security platforms using similar technologies, managing the kind of complex data relationships that AirDNA handles across 120,000 markets.

What excites me most about this role is joining a team that values the "Happy, Hungry, Honest" culture you've described. Throughout my career, I've thrived in collaborative environments—from leading Agile teams at VILT to mentoring developers and participating in code reviews. My approach aligns perfectly with your emphasis on breaking down complex problems, maintaining clean code, and contributing to team knowledge through documentation. The opportunity to work on a mission-driven product that directly impacts people's financial freedom while tackling the technical challenges of processing data from 10M+ listings is exactly the kind of meaningful work I'm looking for.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my Ruby expertise and passion for building scalable, data-driven platforms can contribute to AirDNA's continued growth and technical excellence.
