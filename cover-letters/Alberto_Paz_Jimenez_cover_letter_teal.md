**Teal Hiring Team**  
July 4, 2025

**Dear Lucho and the Teal Team,**

What immediately caught my attention about Teal is your mission to put payroll data—the most reliable indicator of creditworthiness—directly into the hands of both lenders and borrowers. Having spent years building payment processing systems at Flywire and security platforms at ElevenPaths, I understand how transformative the right financial data infrastructure can be. Your approach of making credit decisions more accurate and accessible resonates deeply with my experience in fintech.

Your backing from leading fintech investors and the timing of your recent funding round tells me you're at that exciting inflection point where strong engineering foundations become critical for scale. That's exactly where I thrive—building systems that can handle real-world complexity while maintaining the agility to evolve quickly.

## **Technical Alignment**

My background maps directly to Teal's core requirements:

**JVM Languages & Backend Systems**: My extensive Java experience at VILT and BearingPoint, combined with Scala development at ElevenPaths, provides a strong foundation for Kotlin development. I've built enterprise-grade systems using Spring MVC, Play Framework, and various JVM-based architectures. At Flywire, I optimized payment processing systems for third-party gateway integrations, ensuring high availability for financial transactions—experience that directly applies to building the reliable payroll data connections your platform requires.

**Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps**: I have hands-on AWS experience across multiple roles, including designing Kubernetes architectures at ElevenPaths and optimizing cloud infrastructure at Flywire. My work includes containerization, CI/CD pipeline implementation, and infrastructure management—exactly what's needed for your microservices architecture. I've also worked extensively with PostgreSQL and other database technologies throughout my career.

**REST APIs & Integration**: My experience spans building robust APIs across multiple languages and platforms, from Java/Spring MVC systems to Scala Play Framework applications. At ElevenPaths, I developed integration processors using Java/Apache Camel for real-time data handling, which directly translates to the payroll provider API integrations you need.

## **Language Adaptability as a Strength**

What makes me confident about quickly mastering Kotlin is my proven track record of language versatility. Throughout my career, I've successfully transitioned between:

- **C++** (early career with distributed systems and computer vision)
- **Java** (enterprise applications at VILT and BearingPoint)  
- **Scala** (functional programming at ElevenPaths with Play Framework)
- **Ruby** (recent years at Flywire with Rails)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (frontend development across multiple roles)

This isn't just about syntax—each language taught me different paradigms and approaches to problem-solving. My Scala experience with functional programming concepts and my Java background with JVM internals mean I can leverage both object-oriented and functional programming patterns that Kotlin embraces.

The job description mentions you value "strong general purpose programming language experience" and "a strong desire to learn"—this describes my career perfectly. I've consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly become productive in new languages while bringing valuable perspective from previous experiences.

Regarding LLMs and AI integration, I'm actively exploring this space through personal projects and studying AI applications in software development. My experience integrating complex third-party APIs and building event-driven architectures provides a solid foundation for working with OpenAI APIs and understanding how AI can enhance payroll data processing and analysis.

## **Real-World Problem Solving**

At ElevenPaths, I faced a challenge similar to what Teal encounters: building systems that reliably process sensitive data from multiple sources. We needed to create a multi-tenant security platform that could handle real-time security feeds from various providers while maintaining strict data integrity and availability requirements. I worked on the Java/Apache Camel integration processors that parsed and normalized data from different security sources—experience that directly translates to building robust connections with diverse payroll providers and handling the complexity of reverse-engineering payroll APIs mentioned in your job description.

## **Why Teal?**

Your culture of curiosity and collaborative engineering particularly appeals to me. The "you build it, you run it" philosophy aligns perfectly with my approach to software development. At Flywire, I took ownership of the full lifecycle of features, from initial design through deployment and monitoring. I believe the best solutions come from engineers who understand both the technical implementation and the business impact.

What excites me most is the opportunity to help shape a company from the ground up while working on technology that has genuine social impact. Making credit more fair and accessible isn't just a technical challenge—it's meaningful work that can improve people's lives.

**I'd love to discuss how my experience building reliable, scalable systems and my passion for solving complex problems can help Teal continue building the future of financial data infrastructure.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
