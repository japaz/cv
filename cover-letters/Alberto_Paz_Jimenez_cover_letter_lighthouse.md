**Lighthouse Hiring Team**  
14 June 2025

**Dear Lighthouse Hiring Team,**

I'm thrilled to apply for the **Lead Backend Engineer** position at Lighthouse. Your mission to transform hospitality pricing really connects with me—having built systems that process terabytes of financial data, I know firsthand how the right architecture can turn complex datasets into insights that actually change how businesses operate.

At Flywire, I developed payment processing systems handling millions in transaction volume, where milliseconds mattered and data accuracy was non-negotiable. One project involved streamlining our third-party gateway integrations—I redesigned our backend processes to handle much higher loads more efficiently. This mirrors the kind of high-performance, data-intensive challenges your team faces daily when transforming hotel data into actionable pricing insights.

While my primary expertise is in Ruby on Rails and Java ecosystems, I've consistently demonstrated my ability to rapidly master new technologies. I've worked with Apache Camel at both ElevenPaths and Flywire, adapting it for different integration needs in each environment. I'm excited about diving deep into Python/Go and Google Cloud Platform—technologies I've been exploring personally and am eager to apply professionally.

## Why Lighthouse?

Your engineering culture of experimentation and ownership perfectly matches my working style. At ElevenPaths, building security platforms for 500+ clients, I learned that the best innovations come when engineers have both autonomy and accountability for their code's performance and architecture.

The hospitality industry's pricing complexity fascinates me. Having worked on financial systems where accuracy and performance were critical, I understand how challenging it is to transform raw data into reliable, real-time insights that directly impact revenue. Your focus on intelligent price recommendations for 100,000+ hotels worldwide is exactly the kind of impactful, technically demanding work that drives me.

Beyond my backend expertise, I bring a proven track record of modernizing legacy systems and introducing performance improvements that scale. My experience with microservices architecture, combined with my passion for clean, maintainable code, would help your team continue building the solid service foundation that other engineering teams depend on.

**Let's discuss how I can help Lighthouse illuminate the path to smarter hotel pricing!**

Best regards,
