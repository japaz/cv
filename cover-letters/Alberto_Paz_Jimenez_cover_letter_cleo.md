**Cleo Hiring Team**  
July 15, 2025

Dear Cleo Hiring Team,

When I read about Cleo's mission to change humanity's relationship with money, it struck a chord with me. Having spent years building payment processing systems and watching how technology can either empower or frustrate users, I'm genuinely excited about joining a team that's creating accessible financial tools for everyone, not just the privileged few.

With over 20 years of engineering experience, I've spent recent years at Flywire developing payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS. I've optimized backend performance for third-party payment gateway integrations and led technical debt reduction initiatives that improved code maintainability across the platform.

My background spans both hands-on development and team leadership. I've managed engineering teams of 6-8 developers at VILT and guided technical strategy at ElevenPaths. At VILT, I introduced Agile methodologies that improved delivery predictability, and I built a Java multi-portal framework that reduced maintenance costs significantly for clients like Banco de España.

I've worked extensively with Ruby on Rails, AWS, PostgreSQL, and modern CI/CD practices. At Flywire, I migrated our observability platform from New Relic to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry. I've also worked on Angular and React applications throughout my career.

What draws me to this role is the opportunity to build products that genuinely improve people's lives. Having worked on enterprise systems and security platforms, I'm ready to apply my skills to something with direct social impact. Cleo's approach—profitable while maintaining rapid growth—demonstrates a thoughtful balance between innovation and sustainability.

I'd love to discuss how my experience building scalable financial systems and leading engineering teams can contribute to Cleo's continued success. When can we schedule a conversation about the impact we could create together?

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
