**Stripe Hiring Team**  
May 23, 2025

**Dear Stripe Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Full Stack Engineer, Tax Team** role at Stripe. With over 20 years of experience in full-stack engineering—including significant work on payment systems at Flywire—I'm particularly drawn to Stripe Tax's mission of simplifying the complexity of global tax compliance for businesses.

The challenge of creating a seamless tax compliance solution that spans jurisdictions worldwide represents exactly the kind of ambitious, high-impact project that motivates me. I was particularly impressed by Stripe Tax's rapid launch in 2021 and its potential to remove a major pain point for businesses operating globally.

At Flywire, I worked on several projects that directly relate to the challenges faced by the Tax team:

- **Cross-Border Payment Processing:** Built APIs that handled complex tax implications for educational and healthcare payments across multiple jurisdictions.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Implemented systems that adapted to varied financial regulations across countries, ensuring proper reporting and calculation.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Engineered an integration framework using Apache Camel that connected our payment platform with external systems, similar to the integrations Stripe Tax must maintain.

During a major system overhaul at Flywire, I encountered a particularly challenging tax situation involving Japanese consumption tax that affected international student payments. I researched the regulatory requirements, redesigned our calculation engine, and implemented a solution that correctly handled the complex tax rules while maintaining a simple user experience. This project taught me the importance of abstracting complexity away from users while ensuring complete compliance behind the scenes.

## **Why Stripe's Tax Team?**  

- **Technical Challenge:** The intersection of complex tax rules and elegant user experience presents an engineering challenge that I find intellectually stimulating.
- **Global Impact:** Simplifying tax compliance directly enables more businesses to operate globally—perfectly aligning with Stripe's mission of increasing the GDP of the internet.
- **Early Stage Innovation:** Joining a relatively new product team offers the opportunity to shape its direction and technical foundations.

While I am based in Madrid and would require a fully remote work arrangement, I am enthusiastic about making regular trips to Barcelona to meet with the team in person. I believe that face-to-face collaboration is invaluable, especially for building team rapport and tackling complex challenges. My experience leading distributed teams across Spain and Portugal has prepared me well for this remote work model with periodic in-person collaboration.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with payment systems, regulatory compliance, and API development can help advance Stripe Tax's mission of making tax compliance effortless.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
