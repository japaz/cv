**ICE Hiring Team**  
June 18, 2025

**Dear ICE Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Senior Backend Engineer - Finance Royalty Processing** role at ICE. What truly resonates with me is ICE's mission to ensure creators are fairly compensated for their work—building the technology infrastructure that enables artists to focus on creating amazing music.

With 20+ years building scalable backend systems and event-driven architectures, I bring the technical depth your team needs, along with experience in complex financial processing systems from my work at Flywire.

While developing payment processing systems at Flywire using Ruby on Rails and AWS, I faced similar challenges to what your team handles daily: processing high-volume financial transactions with strict accuracy requirements, integrating with multiple third-party services, and ensuring reliable data flow through event-driven systems. I also migrated our observability platform to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry—experience that translates well to the DataDog monitoring stack you use.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

- **Scalable Architecture:** Built multi-tenant platforms at ElevenPaths using AWS/Kubernetes and designed event-driven services—directly applicable to your royalty processing systems
- **Financial Systems:** Payment processing experience at Flywire provides valuable context for handling financial data accuracy and compliance
- **Scala Foundation:** While not yet expert-level, I have Scala experience and deep knowledge of functional programming principles, with a proven track record of quickly mastering new technologies throughout my career
- **Event-Driven Systems:** Experience with Apache Camel for integration processing and message-driven architectures
- **Team Leadership:** Led distributed engineering teams and introduced Agile practices, improving delivery predictability

I'm particularly drawn to your "you build it, you run it" philosophy and collaborative engineering culture. My experience introducing Agile methodologies and leading technical initiatives aligns perfectly with your team-first approach.

**I'd love to discuss how my backend expertise and passion for supporting creative industries can contribute to ensuring artists receive their rightful royalties.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
