Dear Strapi Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Backend Engineer position. With 20+ years of backend development experience, I bring deep expertise in building scalable enterprise systems that translates well to your Node.js environment.

While my primary background is Ruby on Rails and Java, I've consistently adapted to new technologies throughout my career. My JavaScript/TypeScript skills and backend architecture knowledge position me well for your codebase. At Flywire, I worked with complex payment processing systems requiring the same performance and API design focus that Strapi demands.

When Flywire migrated from New Relic to Honeycomb using OpenTelemetry, I led the transition despite being new to the tools. I quickly mastered the technology and improved our application insights. This demonstrates how strong engineering fundamentals transfer across technologies.

My content management experience at VILT included building Java multi-portal frameworks for enterprise clients, working with systems like OpenText CEM. While different from headless CMS, the core challenges of content organization, user permissions, and API design remain consistent.

I've contributed to open-source projects, notably the JOnAS J2EE application server with published IEEE research on scalability. This gave me insight into maintaining code quality while supporting community contributors—essential for Strapi's growth.

Regarding GraphQL, I haven't used it professionally, typically choosing REST for past projects. However, given my strong API design background, I'm confident I can quickly learn GraphQL patterns.

At VILT, I led teams of 6-8 developers and introduced Agile methodologies. I enjoy mentoring engineers and contributing to technical discussions—valuable skills for your collaborative environment.

I'd welcome discussing how my backend expertise and proven adaptability can contribute to Strapi's continued success.

Best regards,
Alberto Paz Jiménez
