**Dear Elastic Security Detection Rule Management Team,**

When I read about Elastic being used by more than 50% of the Fortune 500, it reminded me of my work at ElevenPaths, where I built a managed security platform that empowered security analysts to detect and respond to threats efficiently. The opportunity to work on detection and alerting features at the core of Elastic Security is exactly the kind of meaningful engineering challenge that drives me.

At ElevenPaths, I implemented an interface that allowed customers and operators to manage all information related to a managed security system. I saw firsthand how the right user experience can transform security operations from reactive fire-fighting to proactive threat management. What particularly excites me about this role is building features that serve detection engineering use cases while working with Generative AI to improve these workflows—I'm currently learning about LLMs and believe AI-powered detection rule management represents the future of security operations.

My technical background aligns strongly with your requirements. While my recent focus has been Ruby on Rails, I have substantial JavaScript experience from frontend work at BearingPoint, VILT, and ElevenPaths. My Elasticsearch experience spans multiple companies where I primarily used it for full-text search capabilities. This hands-on experience with the Elastic stack, combined with my security systems background, gives me the foundation needed to build detection rule management features.

My experience with distributed teams matches perfectly with your global setup. Contributing to the JOnAS application server, I collaborated with people from French institutions. At VILT, I managed a distributed team between Lisbon and Madrid while working with partners in the USA. This taught me the importance of clear async communication—essential for open-source development and distributed collaboration.

The "you build it, you run it" approach aligns with my development philosophy. At Flywire, our team took ownership of payment processing systems from development through production support. I'm excited about contributing to the Kibana codebase and engaging with the Elastic community through GitHub and discussion forums.

**I'd love to discuss how my security systems experience, distributed team collaboration skills, and passion for building developer-focused tools can help the Detection Rule Management team revolutionize security operations.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
