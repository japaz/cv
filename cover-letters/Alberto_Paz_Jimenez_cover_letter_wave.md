**Wave Team**  
July 11, 2025

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Wave. Your mission to make Africa the first cashless continent is both ambitious and inspiring, and I'm drawn to the tangible impact you're making by providing accessible financial services where they're needed most. The opportunity to contribute to a product that improves lives at scale is exactly what motivates me as an engineer.

Throughout my career, I've thrived in environments that value ownership, autonomy, and a focus on real-world outcomes. At Flywire, I worked on global payment solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver features that made complex financial transactions seamless for users. My experience at Telefónica further honed my ability to tackle challenging problems, adapt to new technologies, and deliver reliable solutions in high-stakes environments. In both roles, I quickly learned new languages and frameworks as needed—such as Ruby on Rails, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and others—demonstrating my flexibility and eagerness to master whatever tools best serve the project and users.

I'm particularly drawn to Wave's engineering culture: solving problems holistically, moving fast with purpose, and favoring simplicity and reliability over hype. I share your belief that technology should serve users, not the other way around. My experience in financial technology at Flywire has shown me the importance of building reliable, user-focused solutions, and I'm excited to bring this mindset to Wave's mission of expanding financial access across Africa.

While I don't speak French, I am fluent in English and fully open to traveling to Africa as needed. I'm eager to join a team that values diverse perspectives and is committed to making a difference.

Thank you for considering my application. I'd love to discuss how my background and passion for impactful engineering can contribute to Wave's mission. Looking forward to connecting!

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
