# Senior Software Engineer, Backend - Data Layer Application

Dear Camunda Hiring Team,

What immediately drew me to Camunda is your impressive growth story—crossing $100 million ARR while building technology that powers mission-critical processes for enterprises like NASA, Goldman Sachs, and Atlassian. Your "No Office. No 9-to-5. Just Results." philosophy resonates with my own approach to delivering meaningful technical solutions. The opportunity to join a Data Layer team where my work would directly impact application stability and business decision-making for hundreds of organizations represents exactly the kind of high-impact challenge where I thrive.

Throughout my career spanning over two decades, I've specialized in designing and optimizing data-intensive backend systems—precisely the expertise your Data Layer team needs. My Java experience runs deep, from my early years (2000-2015) when it was my primary language building enterprise platforms at BearingPoint and VILT, to my continued work with Java-based integration systems at ElevenPaths through 2022. At VILT, I led teams developing complex J2EE applications using Spring MVC and Hibernate for clients like Banco de España, where I architected a multi-portal framework that reduced maintenance overhead by 40%—demonstrating the kind of performance optimization focus that's crucial for your data layer.

My database experience aligns perfectly with your technology stack. I've worked extensively with Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, and Elasticsearch across different projects and time periods. At ElevenPaths, I built integration processors using Java and Apache Camel that handled high-volume data flows for our Managed Security Services platform. More recently at Flywire, I optimized backend performance for payment processing systems, working with both relational databases and modern observability tools like Honeycomb and OpenTelemetry—experience that directly translates to monitoring and troubleshooting database performance in data-intensive applications.

What excites me most about this role is Camunda's approach to giving developers complete architectural freedom while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability. Your "executable by design" philosophy—where what you model is exactly what runs, without black boxes or translation layers—aligns with my pragmatic approach to building systems that are both maintainable and scalable. Having published research on J2EE scalability evaluation, I understand the importance of transparent, well-architected systems that can grow with business needs.

I'm particularly drawn to your mission of empowering enterprises to orchestrate their most critical processes. The opportunity to work on systems that directly impact application stability and business decision-making for hundreds of organizations represents the kind of meaningful technical challenge where I thrive. Your rapid growth trajectory and position on GP Bullhound's Next Unicorn list indicates a company that's not just successful, but actively shaping the future of process automation.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building high-performance data systems and leading technical initiatives can contribute to Camunda's continued growth. I'm excited about the possibility of helping your Data Layer team solve complex problems at scale while maintaining the developer-friendly approach that makes Camunda unique.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
