**Dear Huspy Hiring Team,**  

When I read about Huspy's rapid expansion from a digital mortgage platform to the largest proptech company in EMEA in just five years, I immediately thought about my experience scaling payment systems at Flywire and building multi-tenant platforms at ElevenPaths—this is exactly the kind of transformational growth challenge that energizes me as an engineer. I'm applying for the **Senior Backend Engineer** position because your bold vision of building an all-in-one super app for real estate professionals represents the perfect intersection of my technical expertise and passion for revolutionizing traditional industries.

With 20+ years of experience building enterprise systems and leading technical initiatives, I bring exactly the combination of senior engineering experience and product-focused mindset that Huspy seeks. My background spans the full spectrum from individual contribution to technical leadership, with recent experience at Flywire developing payment processing systems and earlier work at ElevenPaths building multi-tenant security platforms.

While my recent work has been primarily in Ruby on Rails, my foundation in **Java and Spring MVC** gives me a strong technical bridge to your **Kotlin/Spring Boot** stack. I've worked with similar architectural patterns and gained exposure to **JavaScript and TypeScript** during Angular development at ElevenPaths. What excites me most is the opportunity to expand into Kotlin while applying my deep understanding of backend systems architecture.

A specific example that demonstrates my product-focused approach: at ElevenPaths, I led the development of a customer portal that needed to serve multiple enterprise clients with different security requirements. Working closely with product and design teams, I architected a flexible multi-tenant system that could adapt to various client needs while maintaining a consistent user experience. This required constant collaboration across teams to balance technical constraints with business requirements—exactly the cross-functional partnership you're looking for.

My **AWS and cloud architecture experience** fits well with your infrastructure needs, and my background with **CI/CD practices** from both Flywire and ElevenPaths will help with your development excellence goals. I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of building systems that scale across multiple markets and regulatory environments, given your expansion across EMEA.

What excites me most about Huspy is your rapid growth and innovative approach to solving real problems for real estate professionals. The combination of working with modern technologies in a collaborative environment while building products that directly impact users' daily workflows is exactly the kind of meaningful engineering challenge I'm looking for.

I'd love to discuss how my experience building complex, user-focused platforms can help with Huspy's continued growth and technical excellence.

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
