**Lago Hiring Team**  
9 June 2025

**Dear Lago Hiring Team,**

I'm excited to apply for the **Senior Back-end Ruby Engineer** position at Lago. Your YC-backed mission to democratize billing infrastructure through open source caught my attention—it's exactly the kind of impactful work that energizes me.

At Flywire, I built Ruby on Rails systems processing millions in payment transactions, including a recurring billing API that handled thousands of daily transactions with 99.9% uptime. What made this challenging wasn't just the scale, but integrating modern Rails with legacy SOAP systems while maintaining financial accuracy—the kind of complex data flow problems I imagine you face daily.

My sweet spot is working with small, technically excellent teams. At ElevenPaths, our core team of 8 engineers built a platform serving 500+ enterprise clients. I thrive in environments where every engineer's voice matters and deep technical discussions drive better solutions.

## Why Lago?

Your team of focused engineers is exactly where I want to contribute. I've consistently done my best work in small, expert teams where technical excellence drives decisions and everyone pushes each other to grow.

Beyond Ruby and event-driven systems, I bring experience with the financial accuracy and compliance challenges that make billing infrastructure genuinely hard. My work with Apache Camel, messaging systems, and microservices would complement your team as we solve the complex problems that other billing platforms avoid.

**Let's discuss how I can contribute to your mission of revolutionizing billing infrastructure!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
