The platform makes it faster, easier, and more cost-effective to create premium digital experiences, allowing businesses to scale it across their go-to-market programs.

Today, Ceros powers some of the most engaging experiences on the web. In 2023 alone, interactive content created with Ceros ‚Äî from websites to landing pages and pitch decks to case studies‚Äî was viewed more than half a billion times, with over 3 million comments added using MarkUp, our visual collaboration tool.

Working at Ceros means making an impact at scale. Our platform supports leading brands including Workday, Colliers, Getty, McKesson, and McKinsey. Ceros is backed by top-tier investors, including Sumeru Equity Partners, Grotech Ventures, and Greycroft.

About the Team
As part of the Ceros Product team, you‚Äôll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you‚Äôve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren‚Äôt afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much. As a member of a remote-first team, you embrace transparency and collaboration.

The Role
Designing and building the Ceros platform is an ambitious task. We require the best-of-the-best Software Engineers, Designers, and Quality Engineers, ready to build a best-in-class web content design studio, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what‚Äôs currently possible.
Our software engineers are all full-stack, able to handle whatever work comes their way. This role is no different, however, we anticipate the responsibilities being initially more backend focused.

We're refactoring a key part of our product to introduce new features that will help our customers take their content creation to the next level. This is a greenfield project focused on innovating a specific component of our product, not merely replicating it. As a candidate, you would be joining one of our modernization teams dedicated to this refactor, playing a crucial role in shaping the future of our product. Our technology stack includes Web Components, React, NextJS, NestJS, AWS Aurora, Yjs, Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, and WebDriver.io, among others. While we‚Äôre driving this innovation, we remain committed to preserving the strengths and stability of the existing product.

Key Responsibilities
Writing well-architected, maintainable code (probably goes without saying)
Planning and leading high-complexity stories and epics
Reviewing story plans and offering insights on impacts to other parts of the application
Collaborating closely with the Quality Engineering team to write and maintain automated and regression tests, ensuring robust and reliable code
Participating in constructive code review sessions that focus on quality and productivity, while balancing the need to ship features in a timely manner
Focusing on delivering an exceptional user experience, with a strong attention to detail that reflects our commitment to creating intuitive and effective products
Participating as a primary on-call resource for service disruptions on rotation
Suggesting new technologies and techniques to improve engineer productivity
Collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices
And finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it
Practical stuff we anticipate you having 
Track record of project ownership and exceptional product delivery
Competent in TypeScript, Node.js and SQL
Knowledgeable on best practices in front-end architecture
Experience working across a broad spectrum of the tech stack, with the ability to assist in tasks such as writing Terraform resources, creating GitHub Actions, or developing API endpoints, in addition to a primary focus on design conversion.
Experience working on realtime applications, examples of which include no-code/whiteboarding/collaboration platforms, visualisation tools, 2D/3D applications in the browser, etc.
Experience working with design formats and understanding their underlying structure is advantageous but not essential
What we're looking for from the heart 
You excel in navigating ambiguity, where complex and evolving requirements are more typical than clear-cut customer demands
You approach large challenges incrementally, preferring a test-and-learn methodology over prolonged heads-down development
You are self-motivated and proactive, with progress often driven by your own initiative and that of your team
Experience in a fast-moving startup environment desirable
You look to uplevel others around you, supporting teams outside of your specific project
Key Things to Know
This is a full-time position
This is a remote-first role, working hours aligned with European time zones
