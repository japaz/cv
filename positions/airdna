About AirDNA
We built AirDNA to solve a problem: how do you make smart short-term rental decisions when there’s too much guesswork and not enough good data?

What started in a garage in California in 2015 is now a global team helping thousands of people — from aspiring hosts to major real estate firms — make confident choices about where to invest, what to charge, and how to grow.

Our mission is simple: give people the tools they need to build freedom through short-term rentals. Whether that means buying their first Airbnb or scaling a portfolio, we’re here to help unlock financial independence and growth.

We track 10M+ listings in 120,000 markets, and our platform is trusted by users in over 100 countries. It’s big data, made useful.

In 2023, AirDNA acquired Uplisting, a powerful property management software that helps hosts and operators manage listings across Airbnb, Vrbo, and other platforms. With features like channel management, automated messaging, dynamic pricing, task coordination, and financial reporting, Uplisting expands our mission to support every stage of the short-term rental journey — from investment to operations.

The AirDNA team
We’re a curious, driven, and kind group of humans who genuinely love what we do. Our values — Happy, Hungry, Honest — guide how we show up for our customers and for each other.

Want to see what that looks like in action? You’ll get a feel once you meet us.
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage you to apply even if you don’t check every box. Passion, potential, and perspective matter here.

The Role
We’re looking for a Fullstack Software Engineer to join our growing team and help build, maintain, and improve our core product features. In this role, you’ll work with other engineers, product managers, and designers to contribute to our applications, which are built using Ruby (Hanami), PostgreSQL, and modern JavaScript frameworks. This is a great opportunity for an experienced developer who enjoys both frontend and backend work, and wants to grow in a fast-moving, data-rich environment.
Here's what you'll get to do:
Contribute to the development of fullstack features across our platform, including backend services and user interfaces.
Write clean, maintainable code and participate in code reviews to help maintain high quality standards.
Collaborate closely with product managers and designers to clarify requirements and shape technical approaches.
Participate in team ceremonies such as sprint planning, standups, and retrospectives.
Test your work thoroughly and ensure smooth handoff to QA and deployment pipelines.
Help investigate and fix bugs, performance issues, and production incidents when they arise.
Contribute to internal documentation to help the team understand and maintain the systems you work on.
Share ideas and feedback to help continuously improve our engineering practices and product experience.
Here's what you will need to be successful:
4-8 years of professional experience as a software engineer working on web applications.
Experience building and maintaining backend services using Ruby (or a similar language); familiarity with Hanami is a plus.
Comfortable writing and debugging SQL queries; experience with PostgreSQL preferred.
Familiarity with building user-facing features using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and a modern framework (Ember, React, etc.).
Experience working with RESTful APIs—either building or consuming them.
Understanding of Git and experience with collaborative workflows (e.g., PRs, code reviews).
Ability to break down complex problems into smaller tasks and deliver them independently or as part of a team.
Comfortable working in an Agile team, open to feedback, and happy to help others when you can.
Here's what would be nice to have:
Experience with JSONAPI or API integration standards.
Familiarity with Hanami, Sidekiq, or cloud-based deployment tools.
Knowledge of frontend performance debugging tools or accessibility standards.
Prior experience in the property management system for short term rentals.
Here's our tech stack:
Ruby / Hanami / rom-rb
JavaScript / Ember
PostgreSQL / Redis
Sidekiq
AWS
GitHub / Gitlab
