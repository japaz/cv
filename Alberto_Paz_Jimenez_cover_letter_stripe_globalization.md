**Stripe Hiring Team**  
May 23, 2025

**Dear Stripe Hiring Team,**  

I'm excited to apply for the **Full Stack Engineer, Globalization Platform** role at Stripe. With over 20 years of full-stack engineering experience across scalable payment systems and enterprise platforms, I'm drawn to Stripe's mission of increasing the GDP of the internet by making global financial infrastructure accessible to businesses worldwide.

What particularly excites me about joining Stripe's Globalization Platform team is the opportunity to directly impact the company's global expansion strategy. Having previously worked on international deployments at Flywire and ElevenPaths, I've seen firsthand how proper localization can dramatically improve customer adoption and satisfaction.

At Flywire, I led several key initiatives with globalization requirements:

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Engineered multilingual APIs capable of handling diverse regional payment methods and currencies across multiple countries.
- **Localization Architecture:** Designed systems to accommodate cultural norms and regulatory requirements in payment processing across various regions.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Worked closely with product, design, and regional teams to ensure culturally appropriate user experiences.

While my experience with Java is primarily from my earlier career at VILT and BearingPoint, where I built enterprise Java/J2EE applications, I've maintained fluency in modern development practices. At ElevenPaths, I built a cloud-native security platform using Scala (Play Framework), which shares the JVM ecosystem with Java. My experience with Ruby on Rails and modern infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes) demonstrates my ability to quickly adapt to new technology stacks.

## **Why Stripe's Globalization Team?**  

- **Mission Alignment:** I'm passionate about building infrastructure that breaks down barriers, which perfectly aligns with Stripe's mission to increase global economic accessibility.
- **Technical Challenge:** The complexity of building systems that scale across languages, cultures, and regulatory environments is exactly the kind of challenge I thrive on.
- **Impact Opportunity:** Contributing to the foundation that enables Stripe's global expansion means creating outsized impact on both the company and its customers.

While I am based in Madrid and would require a fully remote work arrangement, I am enthusiastic about making regular trips to Barcelona to meet with the team in person. I believe that periodic face-to-face collaboration is essential for fostering team cohesion and tackling complex globalization challenges. My experience leading distributed teams across Spain and Portugal has equipped me with the skills needed to collaborate effectively in this model.

**I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with complex systems, payment platforms, and international product development can help accelerate Stripe's globalization efforts.**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
