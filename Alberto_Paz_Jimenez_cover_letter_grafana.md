**Grafana Labs Hiring Team**  
14 June 2025

**Dear Grafana Labs Hiring Team,**

I'm excited to apply for the **Staff Backend Engineer - Grafana Databases Pyroscope** position. What draws me to Grafana Labs is your mission of making observability accessible to everyone—from NASA launches to beehives in the Alps. Having worked on distributed systems that handle critical business processes, I understand how the right observability tools can mean the difference between seamless operations and costly downtime.

Your Pyroscope project particularly resonates with me. As a Universidad Politécnica de Madrid alumnus who has built enterprise systems for over 20 years, I've experienced firsthand the challenge of troubleshooting performance issues without proper profiling data. The idea of building continuous profiling databases that offer line-by-line insights into application performance is exactly the kind of impactful work that energizes me.

At Flywire, I worked on payment processing systems using Ruby on Rails and AWS where performance and reliability were non-negotiable. When we faced intermittent latency spikes in our third-party payment gateway integrations, I had to dig deep into system behavior without sophisticated profiling tools. This experience taught me how valuable continuous profiling would have been—making me appreciate even more what Pyroscope offers to engineering teams worldwide.

## Why Grafana Labs?

Your commitment to **innovation and inclusivity** aligns perfectly with my engineering philosophy. I thrive in environments where every team member's ideas contribute to building dependable solutions. At ElevenPaths, I designed AWS/Kubernetes cloud architecture for a multi-tenant security platform, working closely with distributed teams to deliver solutions that scaled to support enterprise clients.

My experience spans the key areas Grafana Labs values:

- **Distributed Systems:** Built scalable architectures using microservices patterns, message queues (Kafka, ActiveMQ), and cloud-native technologies
- **Cloud Engineering:** Hands-on experience with AWS and Kubernetes deployments, understanding the operational challenges of running systems at scale
- **Full Project Lifecycle:** Led initiatives from requirements gathering through deployment and ongoing support.

While my primary languages have been Ruby, Java, and Scala, I'm confident in my ability to quickly master Go. My C++ background from early career work on distributed testing systems for aircraft equipment provides a solid foundation for systems programming. I've consistently demonstrated adaptability throughout my career—transitioning from J2EE enterprise systems to modern cloud-native architectures.

The **remote-first culture** at Grafana Labs matches my working style perfectly. Having collaborated with distributed teams across Spain and Portugal while working with international clients, I understand the importance of clear communication and self-driven execution in remote environments.

**I'm ready to contribute to Pyroscope's mission of making application performance insights accessible to developers worldwide. Let's discuss how my distributed systems experience and passion for reliable software can help Grafana Labs continue scaling observability solutions!**

Best regards,  
Alberto Paz Jiménez
